To build the application download maven project from https://github.com/ua-eas/kfsdbupgrade and build.

1. create upgrade work directory and copy the following files/directories from project above
   into work directory:

   <kfsdbupgrade-project-directory>/target/kfsdbupgrade-jar-with-dependencies.jar
   <kfsdbupgrade-project-directory>/src/main/resources/kfsdbupgrade.properties
   <kfsdbupgrade-project-directory>/src/main/resources/runupgrade.sh
   <kfsdbupgrade-project-directory>/src/main/resources/upgrade-files
   
2. Edit kfsdbupgrade.properties and fill in entries below with the correct information
   # database information
   database-user=dbuser
   database-password=dbpass
   database-schema=dbschema
   database-driver=dbdriver
   database-name=dbname
   database-url=dburl

   # upgrade information
   upgrade-base-directory=[upgrade-work-directory]

   # logging information
   output-log-file-name=[my-output-log-path]
   processed-files-file-name=[my-processed-files-file-output-path]

3. Edit runupgrade.sh and replace [upgrade-work-directory] with current work directory

4. from the upgrade work execute runupgrade.sh from the command line to run upgrade.
   The upgrade script is written for linux and starts a background java process. 

5. If the upgrade fails it can be restarted from the last successfully processed file by 
   modifying the failed file to fix the issue, setting the "last-processed-file" entry 
   in kfsdbupgrade.properties to the last successfully processed file (get information from logs) 
   and re-running runupgrade.sh.
